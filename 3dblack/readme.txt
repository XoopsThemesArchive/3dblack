Theme created by Webbsida.org for Xoops2 RC3.
<<< Webbsida.org = a newly started swedish community for programmers/designers/others
<<< Please visit us and help us grow! - http://webbsida.org
<<< And you swedes!: Svenska knappar för temat hittar ni också på min sida, tillsammans 
<<< med översättningar av nästan hela xoops. Jag jobbar på det.
Credits: 
Theme was created from a theme called "Summertime" from http://ackbarr.greatweb.com
Icons was borrowed from http://forumimagens.com
Creators note:
<<< I've really missed a dark theme for Xoops2 and therefore I created this, my first one.
<<< I know it isn't bug free, please feel free to change it in any way you like.
How to's:
1. Extract the file "theme_folder_files" and put the folder "3dBlack" in your Xoops2 themes folder.
2. Uplad the 3dBlack[1].tar.gz via the admin/templates option in Xoops2.
3. Change the logo to yours in the 3dBlack theme folder (logo.gif)
The style sheets for NN and Mac might not be 100% acurate although I'm a mac freak by nature.
Due to some lack of features in Xoops many of the imagens might not look great over dark-grey background.
Therefore I've got a full Xoops2 folder zipped at my site - http://webbsida.org
Just look in the downloads section (Nedladdningar = it's swedish)
Notice: Since this is a free theme and time is expensive I might not be able to answer all your questions.
I will try though. Reach me at my site, (once again: http://webbsida.org) or at Xoops.org (alias "fritz_corner")
